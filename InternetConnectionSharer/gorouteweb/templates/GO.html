Build a simple router application called **GoRoute** using the **Go programming language** and the **Gin framework**. The GoRoute backend should handle traffic management, device management, and routing tasks. The **web app** serves as the user interface, interacting with the backend to manage routes, view traffic statistics, and configure network settings.

- Set up backend routes using Gin to handle requests for pages like **Home**, **Dashboard**, and **Device Management**.
- Design reusable components like **sidebar**, **footer**, and **header**, and include them in templates using Goâ€™s `html/template` package.
- Serve static assets such as **CSS**, **JS**, and **images** from a `static` directory.
- Populate HTML templates with dynamic data from the GoRoute backend, such as traffic statistics and device information.
- Focus on simplicity by keeping all templates and components inside the **templates** folder for easy management.
- The web app should interact with the backend through API routes, fetching data like traffic stats, routes, and devices.

Next steps include adding more backend routes for traffic configuration, enhancing the frontend UI, and implementing user authentication.
